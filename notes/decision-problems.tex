  All machine learning problems are essentially decision problems. This essentially means replacing some human decisions with machine decisions. One of the simplest decision problems is classification, where you want an algorithm to decide the correct class of some data, but even within this simple framework there is a multitude of decisions to be made. The first is how to frame the classification problem the first place. The second is how to collect, process and annotate the data. The third is choosing the type of classification model to use. The fourth is how to use the collected data to find an optimal classifier within the selected type. After all this has been done, there is the problem of classifying new data. In this course, we will take a holistic view of the problem, and consider each problem in turn, starting from the lowest level and working our way up.}


\subsection{Simple decision problems}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Preferences}
  \only<article>{The simplest decision problem involves selecting one item from a set of choices, such as in the following examples}  
  \begin{example}

      \item[A] McDonald's cheeseburger
      \item[B] Surstromming

      \item[B] 10,000,000 USD
      \item[C] 10,000,000 BTC
      \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Rewards and utilities}
  \only<article>{In the decision theoretic framework, the things we receive are called rewards, and we assign a utility value to each one of them, showing which one we prefer.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Each choice is called a \alert{reward} $r \in \CR$.
  \item There is a \alert{utility function} $U : \CR \to \Reals$, assigning values to reward.
  \item We (weakly) prefer $A$ to $B$ iff $U(A) \geq U(B)$.
  \end{itemize}
  \only<article>{In each case, given $U$ the choice between each reward is trivial. We just select the reward:
    \[
    r^* \in \argmax_r U(r)
    \]
    The main difficult is actually selecting the appropriate utility function. In a behavioural context, we simply assume that humans act with respect to a specific utility function. However, figuring out this function from behavioural data is non trivial. ven when this assumption is correct, individuals do not have a common utility function.
  }
  \begin{exercise}
    From your individual preferences, derive a \alert{common utility function} that reflects everybody's preferences in the class for each of the three examples. Is there a simple algorithm for deciding this? Would you consider the outcome fair?

    \begin{itemize}
    \item[A] Have 100 EUR now?
    \item[B] Flip a coin, and get 200 EUR if it comes heads?
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{The expected utility hypothesis}

      \]
      where the expected utility is
      \[
      \E(U | A) = \sum_r U(r) \Pr(r | A).
      \]
    \end{block}
    In the above example, $r \in \{0, 100, 200\}$ and $U(r)$ is
    increasing, and the coin is fair.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<3-> If $U$ is convex, we prefer B.
  \item<4-> If $U$ is concave, we prefer A.
  \item<5-> If $U$ is linear, we don't care.

  \frametitle{Uncertain rewards}
  \only<article>{However, in real life, there are many cases where we can only choose between uncertain outcomes. The simplest example are lottery tickets, where rewards are essentially random. However, in many cases the rewards are not really random, but simply uncertain. In those cases it is useful to represent our uncertainty with probabilities as well, even though there is nothing really random.}

\subsection{Decision rules}

\only<article>{We now move from simple decisions to decisions that
  depend on some observation. We shall start with a simple problem in applied meteorology. Then we will discuss hypothesis testing as a decision making problem. Finally, we will go through an exercise in Bayesian methods for classification.}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Bayes decision rules}
  Consider the case where outcomes are independent of decisions:
  \[
  \util (\bel, \decision) \defn \sum_{\model}  \util (\model, \decision) \bel(\model)
  \]
  This corresponds e.g. to the case where $\bel(\model)$ is the belief about an unknown world.
  \begin{definition}[Bayes utility]
    \label{def:bayes-utility}
    The maximising decision for $\bel$ has an expected utility equal to:
    \begin{equation}
      \BUtil(P) \defn \max_{\decision \in \Decision} \util (\bel, \decision).
      \label{eq:bayes-utility}
    \end{equation}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The $n$-meteorologists problem}
  \only<article>{Of course, we may not always just be interested in classification performance in terms of predicting the most likely class. It strongly depends on the problem we are actually wanting to solve. In  biometric authentication, for example, we want to guard against the unlikely event that an impostor will successfully be authenticated. Even if the decision rule that always says 'OK' has the lowest classification error in practice, the expected cost of impostors means that the optimal decision rule must sometimes say 'Failed' even if this leads to false rejections sometimes.}

\subsection{Statistical testing}
\only<article>{A common type of decision problem is a statistical test. This arises when we have a set of possible candidate models $\CM$ and we need to be able to decide which model to select after we see the evidence.
  Many times, there is only one model under consideration, $\model_0$, the so-called \alert{null hypothesis}. Then, our only decision is whether or not to accept or reject this hypothesis.}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Simple hypothesis testing}
  \only<article>{Let us start with the simple case of needing to compare two models.}
  \begin{block}{The simple hypothesis test as a decision problem}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\CM = \{\model_0, \model_1\}$
    \item $a_0$: Accept model $\model_0$
    \item $a_1$: Accept model $\model_1$
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{table}[H]
      \begin{tabular}{c|cc}
        $\util$& $\model_0$& $\model_1$\\\hline
        $a_0$ & 1 & 0\\
        $a_1$ & 0 & 1
      \end{tabular}
      \caption{Example utility function for simple hypothesis tests.}
    \end{table}
    \only<article>{There is no reason for us to be restricted to this utility function. As it is diagonal, it effectively treats both types of errors in the same way.}
  \end{block}

  \begin{example}[Continuation of the medium example]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\model_1$: that John is a medium.
    \item $\model_0$: that John is not a medium.
    \end{itemize}
    \only<article>{
      Let $x_t$ be $0$ if John makes an incorrect prediction at time $t$ and $x_t = 1$ if he makes a correct prediction. Let us once more assume a Bernoulli model, so that John's claim that he can predict our tosses perfectly means that for a sequence of tosses $\bx = x_1, \ldots, x_n$,
      \[
      P_{\model_1}(\bx) = \begin{cases}
        1, & x_t = 1 \forall t \in [n]\\
        0, & \exists t \in [n] : x_t = 0.
      \end{cases}
      \]
      That is, the probability of perfectly correct predictions is 1, and that of one or more incorrect prediction is 0. For the other model, we can assume that all draws are independently and identically distributed from a fair coin. Consequently, no matter what John's predictions are, we have that:
      \[
      P_{\model_0}(\bx = 1 \ldots 1) = 2^{-n}.
      \]
      So, for the given example, as stated, we have the following facts:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item If John makes one or more mistakes, then $\Pr(\bx \mid \model_1) = 0$ and $\Pr(\bx \mid \model_0) = 2^{-n}$. Thus, we should perhaps say that then John is not a medium
      \item If John makes no mistakes at all, then 
        \begin{align}
          \Pr(\bx = 1, \ldots, 1 \mid \model_1) &= 1,
          &
            \Pr(\bx = 1, \ldots, 1 \mid \model_0) &= 2^{-n}.
        \end{align}
      \end{itemize}
      Now we can calculate the posterior distribution, which is
      \[
      \bel(\model_1 \mid \bx = 1, \ldots, 1) = \frac{1 \times \bel(\model_1)}{1 \times \bel(model_1) + 2^{-n} (1 - \bel(\model_1))}.
      \]
      Our expected utility for taking action $a_0$ is actually
    }
    \[
    \E_\bel(\util \mid a_0) = 1 \times \bel(\model_0 \mid \bx) + 0 \times \bel(\model_1 \mid \bx), \qquad
    \E_\bel(\util \mid a_1) = 0 \times \bel(\model_0 \mid \bx) + 1 \times \bel(\model_1 \mid \bx)
    \]
  \end{example}

  \begin{definition}[Null statistical test]
    \only<article>{
      A statistical test $\pol$ is a decision rule for accepting or rejecting a hypothesis on the basis of evidence. A $p$-value test rejects a hypothesis whenever the value of the statistic $f(x)$ is smaller than a threshold.}
    The statistic $f : \CX \to [0,1]$ is  designed to have the property:
    \[
    P_{\model_0}(\cset{x}{f(x) \leq \delta}) = \delta.

    \[
    \pol(a \mid x) =

      a_0, & f(x) \leq \delta\\
      a_1, & f(x) > \delta,
    \end{cases}
    \]
    the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true is exactly $\delta$.
  \end{definition}
  \only<presentation>{The value of the statistic $f(x)$, otherwise known as the \alert{$p$-value}, is uninformative.}
  \only<article>{This is because, by definition, $f(x)$ has a uniform distribution under $\model_0$. Hence the value of $f(x)$ itself is uninformative: high and low values are equally likely.

However nobody does that in practice, meaning that $p$-values are used incorrectly. Better not to use them at all, if uncertain about their meaning.}

\section{Formalising Classification problems}
\only<article>{
  One of the simplest decision problems is classification. At the simplest level, this is the problem of observing some data point $x_t \in \CX$ and making a decision about what class $\CY$ it belongs to. Typically, a fixed classifier is defined as a decision rule $\pi(a | x)$ making decisions $a \in \CA$, where the decision space includes the class labels, so that if we observe some point $x_t$ and choose $a_t = 1$, we essentially declare that $y_t = 1$.

  Typically, we wish to have a classification policy that minimises classification error.

  \frametitle{Deciding a class given a model}
  \only<article>{In the simplest classification problem, we observe some features $x_t$ and want to make a guess $\decision_t$ about the true class label $y_t$. Assuming we have some probabilistic model $P_\model(y_t \mid x_t)$, we want to define a decision rule $\pol(\decision_t \mid x_t)$ that is optimal, in the sense that it maximises expected utility for $P_\model$.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Features $x_t \in \CX$.
  \item Label $y_t \in \CY$.
  \item Decisions $\decision_t \in \CA$.
  \item Decision rule $\pol(\decision_t \mid x_t)$ assigns probabilities to actions.

      This posterior form can be seen as weighing each model according to how well they can predict the class labels.
